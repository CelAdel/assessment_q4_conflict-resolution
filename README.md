# Conflict Resolution Assessment

This respository has been forked from  https://github.com/aezarebski/conflict-resolution-example. In this forked repository (which I named assessment_q4_conflict-resolution), there was a spelling mistake in the code in the 'main' branch. I created a new branch called 'check-spelling', edited the code in this branch from 'Hello Beautiful Wrold' to 'Hello Beautiful World' and committed this change. I then created a new pull request to merge the 'check-spelling' branch with the 'main' branch of my fork, and then deleted the 'check-spelling' branch.
